     * Implementation Note: when V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat() is called by
     * this method to retrieve the TableInputFormat instance to use for a given
     * query, only the VERY FIRST call to V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat() (after
     * the query has been entered on the command line and the input info for
     * the job has been reset) will construct an instance of TableInputFormat;
     * all additional calls -- while that query is executing -- will always
     * return the original instance created by that first call. Note also
     * that in addition to constructing a TableInputFormat instance, that
     * first call to V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat() also populates the
     * splitMap; which is achieved via a call to getSplits() on the newly
     * created TableInputFormat instance.
     *
     * Since the first call to V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat() has already
     * called TableInputFormat.getSplits() and placed the retrieved splits
     * in the splitMap, it is no longer necessary to make any additional
     * calls to TableInputFormat.getSplits(). Not only is it not necessary to
     * call TableInputFormat.getSplits(), but such a call should be avoided.
     * This is because any call to TableInputFormat.getSplits() will result
     * in remote calls to the KVStore; which can be very costly.
     *
     * Thus, one should NEVER make a call such as,
     * V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat().getSplits(); as such a call may result
     * in two successive calls to TableInputFormat.getSplits(). To avoid
     * this situation, one should employ a two step process like the
     * following to retrieve and return the desired splits:
     *
     * 1. First call V1V2TableUtil.getInputFormat(); which when called
     *    repeatedly, will always return the same instance of
     *    TableInputFormat.
     * 2. Call V1V2TableUtil.getSplitMap(), then retrieve and return the
     *    desired splits from the returned map.
