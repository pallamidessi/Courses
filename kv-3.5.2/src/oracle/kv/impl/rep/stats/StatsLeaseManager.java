/**
 * This class manages the leases associated with the statistics tables.
 * An RN must hold a lease associated with partition, or a shard-index before
 * it can update the associated statistics.
 *
 * The lease mechanism is to deal with coordinating scanning among RNs
 * in a shard and deal with the failures of RNs. The mechanism is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Get a partition(or secondary database), and update database to get or
 * create a lease(if a lease associated with the target partition or secondary
 * database exists, then get it, or create a new lease), and then start to scan
 * the partition(or secondary database).
 *
 * 2. During the scanning, check whether the lease expires or not. If the
 * lease is within it's within 10% of its expiry time, extend the expiry time.
 *
 * 3. Extend a lease to ensure the scanning can be completed by a same RN, and
 * also deal with failures. If the current ScanningThread is down during
 * scanning partition(or secondary database), because a lease time is short ,
 * and another ScanningThread within another RN will continue to scan the
 * partition(or secondary database) after the lease time expires.
 *
 * 4. Modify last updated time to ensure the frequency of scanning partitions
 * (or secondary database), and also coordinate scanning among in RNs.
