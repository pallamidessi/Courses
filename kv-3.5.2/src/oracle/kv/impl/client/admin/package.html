Implementations of client side functionality, and network protocols
from the client -> kvstore, for Admin related services. Care should be
taken to segregate client side vs server side classes. The classes
within this package and its subpackages will be included in the
kvclient.jar; they should not have any dependencies on kvstore.jar.
